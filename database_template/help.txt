This .sql file was produced by the PHPMyAdmin plugin for XAMPP. I don't know if it will work for other SQL clients.
To import this file, you must have an empty database called "modslist".
In PHPMyAdmin, select the empty "modslist" database, click "import", and upload the .sql file.
Next, delete the contents of /node_modules/.prisma and the contents of schema.prisma after line 9.
Open a terminal in the project's root folder and run "npx prisma db pull" followed by "npx prisma generate".
The server is now ready to launch using "npm start".
