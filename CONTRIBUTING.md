## Filing A Bug Report

If you're experiencing behavior that appears to be a bug in the CML website/server, you're welcome to [file an issue](https://github.com/celestemods-com/CelesteMods/issues/new). Before you do, please go through this pre-flight checklist:

1. Is the source of the error or problem the CML website/server itself? Please confirm this by reproducing the issue with all browser extensions disabled. Bonus points if you reproduce it in at least 2 browsers.

2. Is your issue a question rather than a bug? If you're having general trouble with the website/server or have questions for the community, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HmQxs3xF3G).

3. Are you the first person to report this issue? [Search the issue list](https://github.com/celestemods-com/CelesteMods/search?type=Issues) to find out. If you aren't, the most helpful thing you can do is vote for the existing issue (add a :+1: reaction to it), and optionally add a comment describing your own experience.

When you're ready to file an issue, please use the [bug report template](https://github.com/celestemods-com/CelesteMods/issues/new?labels=type%3A+bug&template=bug_report.md).

## Requesting a feature

You're also welcome to submit feature requests. When doing so, please [search the issue list](https://github.com/celestemods-com/CelesteMods/search?type=Issues) to see if the enhancement has already been filed.

## Submitting a pull request
Thanks in advance for your contribution.

1. Follow the usual git workflow for submitting a pull request:
    * Fork the project
    * Follow the steps in our [README](/README.md) to get the project running locally
    * Create a new branch from main (e.g. `features/my-new-feature` or `issue/123-my-bugfix`)
    * Add your changes
    * Test the new code locally
      * Be as thorough as you can
      * If there are things you can't test locally, mention them in your pull request
    * Commit your changes and create a pull request
   
3. If you're fixing a bug, also create an issue if one doesn't exist yet.
4. If it's a new feature/enhancement, explain why do you think it's necessary.
5. If your change include drastic or low level changes please discuss them to make sure they will be accepted and what the impact will be.
6. If your change is based on existing functionality, please consider refactoring first. Pull requests that duplicate code will not make it in very quick, if at all.
7. Do not include changes that are not related to the issue at hand.
8. Follow the same coding style with regards to spaces, semicolons, variable naming etc.
