# Individual Mod Page

## Is this a modal or a page?

This is a page. These mockups were created when the plan was to have a modal and a page, but now the plan is for only a dedicated page.


## Image Descriptions

### mockup.png

This image shows the page in its default state. No maps are selected, so the mod's reviews are displayed.


### mockup_withHighlightedMap.png

This image shows the page with a map selected. Instead of displaying the mod's reviews, the map's mapReviews are displayed. If there are no mapReviews, the table should continue displaying the mod's reviews but add a notification above the first row.


## Other Notes

There are a handful of minor changes to the design of the page since these mockups were created. If you want to work on this page, please ask @otobot1 to elaborate.
