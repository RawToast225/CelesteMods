# Site Layout

## Image Descriptions

### mockup.png

This image shows the site as it should look without any pages loaded.

Remove the `CelesteMods.com` link at the bottom, move the cookie and privacy policy buttons to the right side of the footer, rename `My User Account` to `My Account`, and add a `Settings` button at the bottom of the left footer column.
